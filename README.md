To have a fully fun-ctional labwm setup done the easy way, insert ```git clone https://github.com/OrioleNix/dusty.git && cd dusty && bash config.sh``` into your fresh guiless debian 13 install! This isn't the fanciest piece of tech, but it will serve you well to getting yourself fully riced however you like.
